            <h2>hi.</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a silly little creature that does programming as a hobby. I mostly make games or mods for other games. Sometimes I make different applications but they are also connected to games in some way, either for fun or to make some things easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from programming I also like playing games. I know, really original for people like me.
                I really like roguelikes or fast paced games, but from time to time I like to enjoy some relaxing sandbox.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, I also love music. I mostly listen to rock, and subgenres of rock, especially from Aussies.
            </p>

                <h1>Project Soul</h1>
                <p>Project Soul is a 3rd person dungeon crawler that I am working on.</p>
                <p>I started working on this game as a passion project that I wanted to do in my free time when I didn't feel like modding but it eventually became a project for my graduation.</p>
                <p>The main idea of this game is that the player is rediscovering ancient magic called "Soul bending". The player will have research these magical arts and shape them to their liking to utilize their powers in a dark dungeon full of beasts, monsters and other creatures that should remain hidden in the depths.</p>

                <h1>Explorer's Gear</h1>
                <p>This mod attempts to make exploration more fun and enjoyable by adding items themed around travelling.</p>
		<p>Exploration is one of my favorite parts of any video game experience. Exploring enviroments generated or designed by developers has some magic feeling to it, and Minecraft is no exception to this. Unfortunately exploration in Minecraft isn't exactly the most engaging experience, so that's why I wanted to make this mod.</p>
		<p>The mod is currently in Beta and I'm working on adding new and interesting features!</p>
