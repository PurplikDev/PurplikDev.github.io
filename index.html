            <h2>hi.</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a silly little creature that does programming as a hobby. I mostly make games or mods for other games. Sometimes I make different applications but they are also connected to games in some way, either for fun or to make some things easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from programming I also like playing games. I know, really original for people like me.
                I really like roguelikes or fast paced games, but from time to time I like to enjoy some relaxing sandbox.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes I make pixel art, but on a very amateur level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, I also love music. I mostly listen to rock, and subgenres of rock.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I'm a proud Bl√•haj owner. If you know, you know.

                <h1>Krtk!</h1>
                <p>Krtk is a PvP party game made in Godot.</p>
		        <p>It's a game I am currently creating with few of my friends as a passion project with hopes of starting a small Indie Game Development Studio. It's a game where you play as a mole and you want to kill the other players to be the last mole standing.</p>
                <p>The game is still very early in development.</p>

                <h1>Hats & Cosmetics</h1>
                <p>This mod adds new equippable cosmetic items into the game that the player can put on their character.</p>
                <p>My favorite part of video games is when you can make your character look very stylish and dapper. Unfortunately the customization Minecraft provides isn't stylish enough for me, so that's why I made Hats & Cosmetics.</p>
                <p>This project has over 120k downloads in total which I am very thankful for!</p>

                <h1>Explorer's Gear</h1>
                <p>This mod attempts to make exploration more fun and enjoyable by adding items themed around travelling.</p>
		        <p>Exploration is one of my favorite parts of any video game experience. Exploring enviroments generated or designed by developers has some magic feeling to it, and Minecraft is no exception to this. Unfortunately exploration in Minecraft isn't exactly the most engaging experience, so that's why I wanted to make this mod.</p>

                <h1>Risk of Math</h1>
                <p>This is a web application that I made as part of my school project.</p>
		        <p>Basically, I used to play a lot of Risk of Rain 2 and I wanted an easy way to calculate statistics of items and I didn't know that you can mod the game back then, so I made a stat calculator for most of the items and playable characters in JavaScript.</p>
