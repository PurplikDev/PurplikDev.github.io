            <h2>hi.</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a silly little creature that does programming as a hobby. I used to make mods for other games but I've moved on to make games of my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also really enjoy playing video games. I mostly enjoy singleplayer games with interesting puzzles and well crafted story rich moldy worlds such as Outer Wilds, which is my most favorite game ever, Project Silverfish, Hyper Light Drifter and Hollow Knight.
				But I also enjoy co-op and survival games such as Vintage Story, Valheim or PEAK.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, I also like music. I listen to various genres and artists such as Sea Power, willyrodriguez, doefriends, MIDI Bunny and many others. I myself don't make music but I know how to play some simple melodies from games that I like on a guitar like the Travelers theme from Outer Wilds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I'm a proud Blåhaj owner. If you know, you know.

		        <p>
					Predecessor of Extended Roadtrip Northway. The project was mostly focused on creating a moldy broken world that came after a collapse of a society that once stood there. <br>
					The events of the game took place in ruins of a city standing on top of a mega structure from thausands of years ago. This mage structure was used to extract souls from an anomalies known as "Soul Wells" which then powered the city standing above it without realizing they were slowly enraging the wells and causing an even known as "The Collapse" leaving nothing but 1 survivor of the event.
				</p>
				<p>
					The player's goal was to explore the world and figure out what happened to the land while avoiding the original survivor of The Collapse which caused them to slowly turn into a creature barely recognizable as human on the outside, but still alive on the inside.

		        <p>Exploration is one of my favorite parts of any video game experience. Exploring enviroments generated or designed by developers has some magic feeling to it, and Minecraft is no exception to this. Unfortunately exploration in Minecraft isn't exactly the most engaging experience, so that's why I wanted to make this mod.</p>

                <h3>Minecraft mod that adds stress.</h3>
		        <p>I was obsessed with Darkest Dungeon and Thaumcraft at the time an. The player can gain stress by spending time in dark places, not eating or eating bad/unhealthy food. On the other hand the player can reduce their stress be eating better meals and sleeping. Upon hitting a certain stress level the player will roll for an affliction, similarly to Darkest Dungeon, which can be positive or negative.</p>
